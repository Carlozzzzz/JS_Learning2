1. Improve Code Readability
        Add Comments: Use concise comments to explain the purpose of each block or function.
        Organize Code: Group related sections (e.g., HTML initialization, utility functions, event handling, main logic).
        
2. Modularize Functions
        Break large functions into smaller, reusable, single-responsibility functions.
        Key functions to create:
        populateQuestion: Populate the question and choices dynamically.
        startTimer: Handle timer logic for each question.
        handleAnswerSelection: Manage user answer validation and feedback.
        
3. Enhance Timer Logic
        Persist Timer: Use sessionStorage to save the remaining time, ensuring the timer doesn't reset after a page refresh.
        Separate Timer Logic: Create a dedicated module or function for handling timers.
    
4. Add Error Handling
        Validate edge cases:
            Handle missing or undefined questions.
            Gracefully manage invalid or corrupted sessionStorage data.
            Use try-catch blocks for critical operations like JSON.parse().
        
5. Replace Magic Numbers with Constants
        Define repeated values as constants for better maintainability.
        Example:
            const TIMER_DURATION = 10; // seconds
            const ANSWER_DELAY = 3;    // seconds
        
6. Optimize DOM Manipulation
        Cache Elements: Avoid repeated calls to document.querySelector() for the same elements.
        Use Event Delegation: Add a single event listener on a parent container for handling choices.
        
7. Improve User Feedback
        Provide visual or textual feedback:
        Change the timer text color when it's about to expire.
        Highlight correct and incorrect answers using CSS animations or effects.
        Example Feedback Enhancements:
        Timer turns red in the last 5 seconds.
        Fade-in effect for displaying the correct answer.
    
8. Persist Quiz Progress
        Use sessionStorage to save:
            Current question index.
            User score.
            Selected answers.
            Allow users to resume the quiz from where they left off after refreshing the page.

9. Handle Quiz Completion
        Reset all variables and clear intervals when the quiz ends.
        Redirect the user to the results page with proper cleanup.
        Example:
        Clear sessionStorage upon quiz completion.
        Show a message like "Calculating your score..." before redirecting.
10. Testing and Validation
        Test the application in different scenarios:
        Refresh the page during an active timer.
        Load an empty questions array.
        Simulate invalid sessionStorage data.
        Confirm that:
        Timers persist correctly after a page refresh.
        Quiz progress is saved and restored accurately.
        All edge cases are handled gracefully.
